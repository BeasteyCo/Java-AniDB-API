# Java-AniDB-API
Redistributing Grizzlyxp's excellent AniDB API, under the original GPL2 license. 

## Why?
So that it will remain available in case the original site goes down. The last known update was in 2011, and without version control or mirrors, there is a risk that it could be lost. Alternative libraries can be found [here](https://anidb.net/software)

## More info
More information about the project can be found on [Grizzlyxp's website](http://grizzlyxp.bplaced.net/projects/javaanidbapi/index.html)
