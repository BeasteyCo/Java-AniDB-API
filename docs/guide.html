    <h2>Java AniDB API - Beginner's guide</h2>
    <p>
        This is only a short introduction to the Java AniDB API. For more
        information please look at the Javadoc in the
        <a href="index.html#Documentation">documentation</a> section of the
        project page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you are using this library I recommend to read (or glance
        through) the following page: 
        <a href="http://wiki.anidb.info/w/UDP_API_Definition">UDP API Definition</a>.
        I think this way you will gain a deeper insight how the communication
        works, what you should do and what you shouldn't do.
    </p>
   <p>
        First I will point out that there are two ways of using the library:
        Beginner can make use of the main methods and do the library all of the
        work in the background (like flood protection and caching). Experts can
        configure everything to their needs or do it with their own code by
        disabling this functions. At least this are the two design goals.
    </p>
    <p>
        But let's get started with some code:
    </p>
    <h3><a href="doc/net/anidb/udp/UdpConnectionFactory.html">UdpConnectionFactory</a>
    and <a href="doc/net/anidb/udp/UdpConnection.html">UdpConnection</a></h3>
    <p>
        The <code>UdpConnectionFactory</code> is the starting point of the
        library. This class will connect you to AniDB and return a
        <code>UdpConnection</code> object which is the main object you have to
        deal all the time:
        <pre>
            UdpConnectionFactory factory;
            UdpConnection conn = null;
            
            factory = UdpConnectionFactory.getInstance();
            try {
                conn = factory.connect(1025);
                
                // Here you can insert your queries.
                
            } catch (Throwable t) {
		t.printStackTrace();
	    } finally {
		try {
                    if (conn != null) {
			conn.close();
                    }
		} catch (Throwable t) {
                    t.printStackTrace();
		}
	    }
        </pre>
        First you will fetch an instance of the class
        <code>UdpConnectionFactory</code>. After that you connect to AniDB with
        the local port <code>1025</code> and get a <code>UdpConnection</code>
        object. If we speak about the
        <a href="http://wiki.anidb.info/w/UDP_API_Definition">AniDB UDP API</a>
        we also speaking about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol">UDP</a>.
        This is in comparision to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>
        a stateless protocol. So you should allways call the
        <a href="doc/net/anidb/udp/UdpConnection.html#close()"><code>close()</code></a>
        method. Otherwise AniDB will keep the connection open for some time
        which will cause unnecessary load for the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some commands you can use now and some you have to
        authenticate your client and yourself for. Some of the commands which
        works also in the un-authenticate state are
        <a href="doc/net/anidb/udp/UdpConnection.html#ping()"><code>ping()</code></a> and
        <a href="doc/net/anidb/udp/UdpConnection.html#getServerVersion()"><code>getServerVersion()</code></a>.
        But for most of the commands you have to authenticate:
        <pre>
                conn.authenticate("&lt;anidb username&gt;", "&lt;anidb password&gt;");
        </pre>
        or if you want to authenticate your own client instead of the library:
        <pre>
                conn.authenticate("&lt;anidb username&gt;", "&lt;anidb password&gt;", "&lt;clientname&gt;", &lt;clientversion&gt;);
        </pre>
        For more information see also:
        <a href="doc/net/anidb/udp/UdpConnection.html#authenticate(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)"><code>authenticate(String, String)</code></a>
        and <a href="doc/net/anidb/udp/UdpConnection.html#authenticate(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20int)"><code>authenticate(String, String, String, int)</code></a>
        <br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you can use all the other commands. One point at the end of the
        guide: The return values from the data command methods.<br /><br />
        All the returned objects are
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POJO">POJO</a>s.
        Some of them contain other objects, like objects of the
        <a href="doc/net/anidb/Episode.html"><code>Episode</code></a> class
        which contains a <a href="doc/net/anidb/Anime.html"><code>Anime</code></a>
        object. So if you want to get the anime Id, you have to get the anime
        object from the episode object and get the anime Id from it. Maybe it
        looks a little bit long-drawn-out, but is a design decission for
        extensions in the future (e.g. 1st and 2nd level caching).<br />
        The <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals(Object)</code> methods are
        implemented for all classes of <code>net.anidb.*</code> and
        <code>net.anidb.udp.mask.*</code>. But for some classes they are only
        working under special circumstances - as it is not reasonable in every
        state. An example: For the class <a href="doc/net/anidb/Anime.html"><code>Anime</code></a>
        <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals(Object)</code> will only
        produce result which make sense if the anime Id is set.
