Version 0.3 - 31.07.2010

- Corrected the flood protection:
  The "bonus" packets will be send by 0.5 packets per minute, means 1 packet
  every 2 seconds.
- Not all packages were exported into the jar file in version 0.2. And also
  there was not all JavaDoc created for all classes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.2 - 02.03.2010

- Implemented some more commands:
    - NOTIFYLIST
    - NOTIFYGET
    - NOTIFYACK
    - SENDMSG
    - USER
- Supports encodings: The default encoding after the start of the connection
  will be US-ASCII as described in the UDP API Definition. After the
  AUTHENTICATE command the library will automatically switch to UTF-8 which will
  be the most common enconding most developers will use.
  And the library does some HTML decoding now, too.
- Improved the flood protection: If you have send the first 4 packets, you will
  be in "1 packet per 30 seconds" mode. The difference is now that you can earn
  a "bonus" means you will get a bonus every 30 seconds you don't send a packet.
  This "bonus packets" will be send by the initial rate of 1 packet every 0.5
  seconds until the bonus is spend.
- Checksum / hash calculation: As other libraries with this functions are far
  more big than this, I made a light-weight implementation of the hash functions
  you need for AniDB: Crc32, Ed2k, Md4 (used by Ed2k), Md5, Sha160, Tiger (used
  by Tiger Tree) and last, but not least, Tiger Tree.
- I added some logging for debbuging purposes. And I decided to use the Apache
  Commonds Logging package: http://commons.apache.org/logging/
  For further information look at the JavaDoc of the
  net.anidb.logging.AbstractLog class. I recommend to use at least the "warn"
  log level.
- Additional fields are covered now, too. In the last version you got an
  exception if the response had more fields than expected. This is the case when
  the developers of AniDB.net add some fields. Now you will get a "warn" message
  into the log.
