Welcome to the Java AniDB API - A Java API for AniDB.net

I saw that a lot of client projects used Java as the programming language. So I
thought I could be of help if I would develop an API for AniDB.net. This way
not every developer has to implement all the functions over and over again. The
other side is that if many clients use the same library it will be easier to
find mistakes and a lot more people can bring their ideas in this software. And
they can concentrate more on their clients, too.

If you have any question or comments, don't hesitate to contact me. You can send
me a message on AniDB and you can also use the developer forum on AniDB:

You are using the Java AniDB API for your project, but you don't have any
particular question or comment? Please let me know, too. Maybe I can do some
advertising on the project website:

http://grizzlyxp.bplaced.net/projects/javaanidbapi/index.html

And that would be a good advertisment for the project, too. (^,@)

Look at the history.txt for all the canges I made.

Take care
